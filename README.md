# ‚úíÔ∏è Dante

An unpolished grammar checker powered by OpenAI models and [Neovim builtin diff tool](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diff.html). Seriously, it's just a proof of concept.

## üí° Idea

I want to experiment with the newlly released [GPT Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview). Vim/Neovim builtin diff tool is a good way to highlight the differences between the original text and the suggested one.
**Edit**: I move from GPT Assistant API back to *chat completions* API because it was easy to implement API in a non-blocking fashion.

## ‚ú® Features

- Prompt selected line into LLM and highlight the differences with the original text.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.9**
- curl
- Access to OpenAI API

## üì¶ Installation

1. Install using a plugin manager

```lua
-- using lazy.nvim
{
  "s1m0n38/dante.nvim",
  opts = {
    model = "gpt-4-1106-preview", -- best model but more expensive
    temperature = 0, -- reduced creativity
    prompt = "You are tasked as an assistant primarily responsible for rectifying errors within English text. Please amend spelling inaccuracies and augment grammar; ensure that the refined text closely adheres to the original version. Given that the text is authored in LaTeX intended for a master's thesis, please abide by the LaTeX syntax accordingly. Eschew informal expressions and choose terminology appropriate for a scientific manuscript. Provide your corrections in the form of the enhanced text only, devoid of commentary. Maintain the integrity of the original text's new lines and the spacing.", -- system prompt
  },
}
```

2. [get an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and add it to your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## üöÄ Usage

**Normal Mode**

- `:Dante` send current line to LLM.

**Visual Mode**

- `:'<,'>Dante` send selected lines to LLM.

Read the [documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diff.html) to learn how to navigate between and edit differences.
