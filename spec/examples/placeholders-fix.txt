PLACEHOLDERS                                              *dante-placeholders*

Placeholders are used to inject context in request messages. They have the
form `{{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}}`. The following placeholders are supported:

- `{{SELECTED_LINES}}`: The selected lines in the buffer. This selection is
  obtained from the range given while using `Dante` command. See
  |dante-commands|.

- `{{NOW}}`: It will be replaced by the current date and time. For example:
  "Today is Wed, 04 Sep 2024 08:22:32 +0200"
